# Brightspace Access

Brightspace is the main Learning Management System (LMS) used for course content, assignments, grades, and communication. As a TA/TR, you will be given access to assist with grading, managing submissions, creating announcements, or answering student questions.

## Getting Access

- Once you fill out all necessary paperwork, the department will request secondary instructor access for the courses you’re supporting.
- Once granted, you should be able to see your name on the schedule and have access via *My Courses* under [Brightspace](https://mylearning.suny.edu/). 
- If you do not see your course after the first week of classes, notify the graduate coordinator ([hoffmank4@newpaltz.edu](mailto:hoffmank4@newpaltz.edu)).
