# Technical Help

As a TR, you may encounter technical issues, whether in Brightspace, email, or other course-related systems. While you are **not responsible for fixing technical problems**, it’s important to know where to direct questions and how to handle issues if they arise.

## Common Scenarios

- **Brightspace issues** (e.g., can’t access a course, grading glitches): Report to the instructor first, then IT Support if needed: [Request Brightspace Service](https://newpaltz.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1905/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=51541)

- **Email or account login issues**: Direct students (and yourself, if needed) to the campus IT Help Desk: [Submit a Ticket](https://newpaltz.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1905/Portal/Requests/ServiceCatalog)

- **Classroom technology problems** (projector, software, etc.): A common issue is the projector not working when instructing a lab. Instead of submitting a ticket, which could take hours, **call them directly** at **[845-257-4357]((tel:8452574357))**. Explain the situation, and they will have someone come down as soon as possible to fix the issue.

## What TRs Should NOT Do

- Do not attempt to repair or reset institutional accounts.  
- Do not install unauthorized software on lab or classroom computers.  
- Do not share admin or instructor login credentials.

## Where to Go for Help

- **Course Instructor** – first point of contact for anything course-related (see [Important Contacts](/5%20Resources/Important%20Contacts.md)).  
- **[IT Help Desk](https://newpaltz.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1905/Portal/Home/)** – for technical support with accounts, email, or hardware.  
- **[Brightspace Support](https://newpaltz.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1905/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=51541)** – for grading, course content, or access problems.  

Keep these contacts saved for quick access. If you’re unsure where to go, always start with the instructor.
