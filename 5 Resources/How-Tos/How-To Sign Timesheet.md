# How-To Sign Timesheet

1. You can sign the Timesheet electronically in any way you would like, as long as it's not typed or physically handed in. This is just one way to sign using the drawing tool in Outlook. Please see [Timesheet Submissions](/3%20Tasks%20and%20Responsibilities/Timesheets%20Submission.md) if more clarification is needed.

2. In the reminder email sent by me at the end of every month, click on the down arrow on the attached form, and click ***Save to OneDrive - State University of New York at New Paltz***.
