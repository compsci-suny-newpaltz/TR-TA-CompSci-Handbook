# Weekly Checklist

This checklist outlines your regular responsibilities as a TA/TR. Use it as a guide each week to stay on track and ensure nothing is overlooked.

## Beginning of the Week

- Check email and Brightspace for any new announcements or tasks from the instructor.
- Review upcoming materials, assignments, quizzes, and/or exams for the week. Office hours are usually busy during exam weeks, so be sure to go over previous labs and materials to best prepare for student questions.

	  - Be prepared to answer student questions. 
	  - Keep track of common issues to report back to the instructor.
	  - If you need to cancel or reschedule your office hours, let both the instructor and students know. Brightspace allows you to create and send announcements that will send an email to all students in the course. See [How-To Create an Announcement](../5%20Resources/How-Tos/How-To%20Create%20an%20Announcement.md) for a quick tutorial.
