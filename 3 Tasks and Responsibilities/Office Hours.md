# Office Hours

Office hours are your opportunity to provide students with extra help, answer questions, and support their learning outside of class. They are an important part of your responsibilities as a TR.

## Setting Up Office Hours

- Decide on the day and time of your hours before the first week of classes. 
  - Part-time TRs/TAs must hold **1.5 hours per week**
  - Full-time TRs/TAs must hold **3 hours per week**
  - Make sure your hours are not during lecture hours!

- Once decided, notify administrative assistant, Ashlee Dykeman ([dykemana2@newpaltz.edu](mailto:dykemana2@newpaltz.edu)), and your instructor your intended hours. Ashlee will assign you either room SH 240 or 241.
	- You will be given card access to both rooms at the beginning of the semester. If you don't have access, please let Ashlee know. 

- Hold office hours at the **time and location arranged with your instructor**. If you must move locations, make an announcement via Brightspace.    
- Share your office hours via a Brightspace announcement and/or with your students on the first day of lab. Some instructors will include your hours on their syllabus.

## Expectations

- Arrive on time and stay for the full duration.  
- Be approachable, respectful, and patient.  
- Come prepared with course materials so you can reference them if needed.

## Working with Students

- Encourage students to ask questions and guide them toward solutions instead of simply giving answers.  
- Offer tips, hints, and strategies that help students learn.  
- Keep explanations clear and adjust based on the student’s level of understanding.  
- Respect confidentiality. Do not discuss other students’ grades or performance.  

---
## Handling Challenges

- If a student becomes frustrated or confrontational, remain calm and professional.  
  - Listen, acknowledge their concern, and suggest following up with the instructor if needed.  
- If you cannot answer a question, be honest. Take note and follow up after checking with the instructor.  
- If very few students attend, use the time to review materials, grade assignments, or do your own coursework.

## Cancellations & Rescheduling

If you must miss office hours due to illness or another conflict:  
- Inform the instructor as soon as possible.  
- Post an announcement (through Brightspace or email) to let students know.  
- If appropriate, reschedule a make-up session.
