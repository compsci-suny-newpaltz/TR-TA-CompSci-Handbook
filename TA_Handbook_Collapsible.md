## Boundaries

- Do not tutor students outside of your assigned course unless explicitly approved. ***Your mental health and time matter***; do not let yourself become burned out or feel obligated to do more than what your role requires. 
- Do not share personal social media accounts or engage in inappropriate relationships with students.
- **Avoid gossip or discussing students or faculty with others.** Maintain professionalism and discretion when speaking with students, fellow TAs, or faculty members. If you have concerns, speak directly with the instructor or appropriate staff.



---

# Communication Guidelines


Strong and respectful communication is key to your success as a Teaching Assistant. You’ll interact with students, faculty, and possibly other TAs—so here are a few best practices to help keep everything running smoothly.

---
## Email & Messaging

- Use your official school email when communicating with students and faculty.
- Check your email regularly (at least once a day on weekdays).
- Aim to respond to emails from students and instructors within **24–48 hours**.
- Use clear subject lines and professional greetings.

> Example:  
> *Subject: Question about Homework 3 Grading*  
> *Hi <Student's Name>,*  
> *Thanks for your message. I reviewed your assignment and here's what I found...*

---
## Interacting with Students

- Be kind, respectful, and patient.
- Avoid sarcasm or overly informal language. Remember, you’re in a position of authority.
- If you’re unsure how to handle a situation, or a student becomes confrontational, reach out to the instructor.
- Never discuss other students’ performance or personal situations unless with the instructor.

---
## Communicating with Faculty

- Let the instructor know if you're going to be unavailable or need help.
- Share any student issues that might require follow-up (e.g., missing assignments, struggling students, academic honesty concerns).
- When in doubt, ask!

---
## Professionalism Reminder

- Never gossip or speak negatively about students or faculty.
- Keep communication polite, even when setting boundaries or correcting misunderstandings.

---
Consistent, respectful communication helps create a positive learning environment for everyone.

# Role Overview


As a TA/TR, you play a vital role in supporting course delivery and enhancing student learning. Below is a breakdown of expectations, workload, and eligibility to help you succeed.

---
## Assistantship Types & Workload

There are three common types of assistantships:

- **Teacher of Record (TR):** Serves as the primary instructor for a course.
- **Teaching Assistant (TA):** Assists faculty with classroom instruction, grading, tutoring, and sometimes facilitating discussions or labs.
- **Graduate Assistant (GA):** Supports faculty or administrators with research, administrative, or technical duties (not instructional).

- **Full-Time Assistantships**: Approximately 20 hours of work per week.
- **Half-Time/Part-Time Assistantships**: Approximately 10 hours per week.

Your actual workload may fluctuate slightly throughout the semester based on grading schedules, assignment deadlines, and course needs.

---
## Eligibility and Appointment Guidelines

- You must be a **matriculated graduate student in good academic standing**, maintaining at least a **3.0 GPA**.
- You must be enrolled in at least **6 graduate credits per semester** regardless if you are a Part-Time or Full-Time.
- TA appointments are formalized through an **official appointment letter** and completed hiring paperwork.
- Compensation includes a stipend and tuition waiver. The amount depends on your assignment.

---
## Why This Role Matters

As a TA, your support helps students succeed academically. Whether through grading, providing feedback, holding office hours, or answering student questions, you are a key part of the educational experience.

You’ll also develop valuable skills in teaching, time management, and communication that can benefit your academic and professional growth.

# Brightspace Access


Brightspace is the main Learning Management System (LMS) used for course content, assignments, grades, and communication. As a TA/TR, you will be given access to assist with grading, managing submissions, creating announcements, or answering student questions.

---
## Getting Access

- Once you fill out all necessary paperwork, the department will request secondary instructor access for the courses you’re supporting.
- Once granted, you should be able to see your name on the schedule and have access via *My Courses* under [Brightspace](https://mylearning.suny.edu/). 
- If you do not see your course after the first week of classes, notify the graduate coordinator ([hoffmank4@newpaltz.edu](mailto:hoffmank4@newpaltz.edu)).

---
## What You Can Do in Brightspace

Your permissions may vary by course and instructor, but typically you’ll be able to:

- View course content and announcements
- Create and send announcements and emails
- Access student submissions
- Grade assignments and quizzes
- Leave written feedback
- View and update the gradebook (if permitted)

If you're unsure about your specific permissions, ask your instructor to clarify. If needed, see [[How-To Sign Timesheet]] for Brightspace tutorials.

---
## Guidelines for Using Brightspace

- Double-check all grades and feedback before releasing them.
- Only grade what your instructor assigns to you. Don’t assume you should grade everything unless told.
- Never change or delete course content without permission.
- Keep all student information confidential.

---
## Need Help?

If you run into issues with Brightspace access or features:

- First, check with the course instructor.
- For technical issues, contact the IT Help Desk and [Request Brightspace Service](https://newpaltz.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1905/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=51541).



---

# Technical Help


As a TA, you may encounter technical issues, whether in Brightspace, email, or other course-related systems. While you are **not responsible for fixing technical problems**, it’s important to know where to direct questions and how to handle issues if they arise.

---
## Common Scenarios

- **Brightspace issues** (e.g., can’t access a course, grading glitches): Report to the instructor first, then IT Support if needed: [Request Brightspace Service](https://newpaltz.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1905/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=51541)

- **Email or account login issues**: Direct students (and yourself, if needed) to the campus IT Help Desk: [Submit a Ticket](https://newpaltz.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1905/Portal/Requests/ServiceCatalog)

- **Classroom technology problems** (projector, software, etc.): A common issue is the projector not working when instructing a lab. Instead of submitting a ticket, which could take hours, **call them directly** at **[845-257-4357]((tel:8452574357))**. Explain the situation, and they will have someone come down as soon as possible to fix the issue. 

---
## What TRs/TAs Should NOT Do

- Do not attempt to repair or reset institutional accounts.  
- Do not install unauthorized software on lab or classroom computers.  
- Do not share admin or instructor login credentials.  

---
## Where to Go for Help

- **Course Instructor** – first point of contact for anything course-related (see [[Important Contacts]]).  
- **[IT Help Desk](https://newpaltz.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1905/Portal/Home/)** – for technical support with accounts, email, or hardware.  
- [**Brightspace Support**](https://newpaltz.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1905/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=51541) – for grading, course content, or access problems.  

Keep these contacts saved for quick access. If you’re unsure where to go, always start with the instructor.

# How To Grade In Brightspace

1. Access course in Brightspace. (see [[How-To Access Course in Brightspace]])

- There are a few ways to grade depending on if the submissions are through [[#Online Submissions via Brightspace]] or if submissions are [[#Physical Submissions]].
- **NOTE:** Not all instructors will have you grade in Brightspace or at all. Be sure to clarify grading expectations with them.

## Online Submissions via Brightspace

2. If you are grading assignments that were submitted through Brightspace, one way to grade is by using the *Quick Eval* option. First, click on the ***Instructor Only*** button on the navigation bar. Then, click ***Quick Eval***.

<summary><strong>Using Your Own Computer</strong></summary>

## Using Your Own Computer

1. If using your own computer, you can connect using  an HDMI cord, AirPlay or Crestron AirMedia. Not all projector systems have AirPlay or Crestron AirMedia. Double check what the lab/classroom you are assigned to has available. Having an HDMI cord is a good idea to have with you if you are planning to use your own computer due to the unpredictability with each projector system.

2. To display an image from an HDMI source:
	- Connect your equipment using an HDMI cable that you provide to the HDMI port on the front of the instructor station or desktop.
	- Press the **HDMI** button on the control panel

3. To wirelessly display a personal device through Crestron AirMedia:
	- Press the **AIR MEDIA** button on the control panel
	- Please read **[How To Use Crestron AirMedia](https://newpaltz.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/KB/ArticleDet?ID=32528)**


## Other features

- Press the **FREEZE** button to freeze the image on the Projector
- Press the **BLANK** button to temporary blank the image on the Projector
- Press the up directional button to raise the projector screen
- Press the down directional button to lower the projector screen
