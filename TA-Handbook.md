# TA Handbook

# Grading Duties


As a TR/TA, grading is one of your most important responsibilities. Your work helps ensure fairness, consistency, and timely feedback for students.  

---
## General Expectations

- Follow the rubric and instructions provided by the instructor.  
- Grade consistently across all submissions. Avoid being stricter or more lenient with certain students.  
- Provide **constructive feedback** that helps students learn and improve.  
- Complete grading within the **timeline set by the instructor** (often 1 week).  

---
## Best Practices

- Skim through a few submissions before grading all to get a sense of common approaches and errors.  
- If unsure how to grade something, mark it for review and ask the instructor.  
- Keep feedback professional and respectful.  
- Double-check entries in Brightspace before releasing grades.  

---
## Academic Integrity

- If you suspect plagiarism, cheating, or other misconduct:  
	  - **Do not confront the student directly.**  
	  - Flag the submission and notify the instructor immediately.  

- Examples of concerns include:  
	  - Code that appears copied from another student or online source.  
	  - Unusual similarities in written responses.  

---
## Using Brightspace for Grading

- Enter grades only for the assignments the instructor assigns to you.  
- Add feedback in the comments section when possible.  
- Double-check totals and categories before publishing grades.

---
By grading carefully and consistently, you support fairness in the course and help students learn from their mistakes.


---

# Mailroom


The department mailroom is located in **SH 253**. Each TR/TA is assigned a mailbox and should check it regularly. The mailroom is also equipped with a copier and a small fridge. This space is for faculty and staff only. Students should never have access.

---
## Mailbox Use

- You will be assigned a mailbox at the start of the semester.  
- Check your mailbox **at least once per week**.  
- Professors may place quizzes, exams, or other materials in your mailbox to distribute.  
- Remove materials promptly to avoid overcrowding.  

---
## Copier Use

- A copier is available for course-related materials.  
- Use it responsibly. Large or special print jobs should be cleared with the department office first.  

---
## Fridge Use

- A small refrigerator is available for storing personal food or drinks.  
- Please label your items and remove them at the end of each week.  
- Keep the fridge tidy for shared use.  

---

- If a student needs to pick something up, coordinate with the instructor to arrange a proper handoff.  

---
The mailroom is both a resource and a shared space. Please use it responsibly and maintain professionalism when accessing it.


---

# Office Hours


Office hours are your opportunity to provide students with extra help, answer questions, and support their learning outside of class. They are an important part of your responsibilities as a TA.

---
## Setting Up Office Hours

- Decide on the day and time of your hours before the first week of classes. 
	- Part-time TRs/TAs must hold **1.5 hours per week**
	- Full-time TRs/TAs must hold **3 hours per week**
	- Make sure your hours are not during lecture hours!

- Once decided, notify administrative assistant, Ashlee Dykeman ([dykemana2@newpaltz.edu](mailto:dykemana2@newpaltz.edu)), and your instructor your intended hours. Ashlee will assign you either room SH 240 or 241.
	- You will be given card access to both rooms at the beginning of the semester. If you don't have access, please let Ashlee know. 

- Hold office hours at the **time and location arranged with your instructor**. If you must move locations, make an announcement via Brightspace.    
- Share your office hours via a Brightspace announcement and/or with your students on the first day of lab. Some instructors will include your hours on their syllabus. 

---
## Expectations

- Arrive on time and stay for the full duration.  
- Be approachable, respectful, and patient.  
- Come prepared with course materials so you can reference them if needed.  

---
## Working with Students

- Encourage students to ask questions and guide them toward solutions instead of simply giving answers.  
- Offer tips, hints, and strategies that help students learn.  
- Keep explanations clear and adjust based on the student’s level of understanding.  
- Respect confidentiality. Do not discuss other students’ grades or performance.  

---
## Handling Challenges

- If a student becomes frustrated or confrontational, remain calm and professional.  
	  - Listen, acknowledge their concern, and suggest following up with the instructor if needed.  
- If you cannot answer a question, be honest. Take note and follow up after checking with the instructor.  
- If very few students attend, use the time to review materials, grade assignments, or do your own coursework. 

---
## Cancellations & Rescheduling

- If you must miss office hours due to illness or another conflict:  
	  - Inform the instructor as soon as possible.  
	  - Post an announcement (through Brightspace or email) to let students know.  
	  - If appropriate, reschedule a make-up session.  

---
Office hours are about building trust and providing students with the extra support they need. Your approachability and consistency make a big difference!


---

# Timesheets Submission


As a TA, you are required to submit a monthly **TA/GA Attendance Report** to record any absences. Submitting this form correctly and on time ensures you are paid without delays. 

---
## Deadlines

- Your timesheet is **due to me by the 5th of each month** for the previous month’s work.  
- Late submissions may delay your stipend payment.  

---
## Monthly TA/GA Attendance Report Form

- You will receive an email reminder from me at the end of each month, with the form attached. 
- The form can also be found here: [Monthly TA/GA Attendance Report (PDF)](https://www.newpaltz.edu/media/payroll/monthlyta-gaattendancereport.pdf)  

---
## !IMPORTANT: Signing Instructions

- You **MUST** sign the form with an actual signature. **Typing your name is not allowed!
- If you don't know how to sign electronically, one way is to use the Drawing Tool in Outlook's PDF viewer. See [[How-To Sign Timesheet]] for detailed instructions. 
- Printed copies will **NOT** be accepted. All timesheets must be sent via email to me.

---
## Submitting Your Time Sheet

# Role Overview


As a TA/TR, you play a vital role in supporting course delivery and enhancing student learning. Below is a breakdown of expectations, workload, and eligibility to help you succeed.

---
## Assistantship Types & Workload

There are three common types of assistantships:

- **Teacher of Record (TR):** Serves as the primary instructor for a course.
- **Teaching Assistant (TA):** Assists faculty with classroom instruction, grading, tutoring, and sometimes facilitating discussions or labs.
- **Graduate Assistant (GA):** Supports faculty or administrators with research, administrative, or technical duties (not instructional).

- **Full-Time Assistantships**: Approximately 20 hours of work per week.

---
## Why This Role Matters

As a TA, your support helps students succeed academically. Whether through grading, providing feedback, holding office hours, or answering student questions, you are a key part of the educational experience.

You’ll also develop valuable skills in teaching, time management, and communication that can benefit your academic and professional growth.



---

# Brightspace Access


Brightspace is the main Learning Management System (LMS) used for course content, assignments, grades, and communication. As a TA/TR, you will be given access to assist with grading, managing submissions, creating announcements, or answering student questions.

---
## Getting Access

- Once you fill out all necessary paperwork, the department will request secondary instructor access for the courses you’re supporting.
- Once granted, you should be able to see your name on the schedule and have access via *My Courses* under [Brightspace](https://mylearning.suny.edu/). 
- If you do not see your course after the first week of classes, notify the graduate coordinator ([hoffmank4@newpaltz.edu](mailto:hoffmank4@newpaltz.edu)).

---
## What You Can Do in Brightspace

Your permissions may vary by course and instructor, but typically you’ll be able to:

- View course content and announcements
- Create and send announcements and emails
- Access student submissions
- Grade assignments and quizzes
- Leave written feedback
- View and update the gradebook (if permitted)

If you're unsure about your specific permissions, ask your instructor to clarify. If needed, see [[How-To Sign Timesheet]] for Brightspace tutorials.

---
## Guidelines for Using Brightspace

- Double-check all grades and feedback before releasing them.
- Only grade what your instructor assigns to you. Don’t assume you should grade everything unless told.
- Never change or delete course content without permission.
- Keep all student information confidential.

---
## Need Help?

If you run into issues with Brightspace access or features:

- First, check with the course instructor.
- For technical issues, contact the IT Help Desk and [Request Brightspace Service](https://newpaltz.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1905/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=51541).



---

# Technical Help


As a TA, you may encounter technical issues, whether in Brightspace, email, or other course-related systems. While you are **not responsible for fixing technical problems**, it’s important to know where to direct questions and how to handle issues if they arise.

---
## Common Scenarios

- **Brightspace issues** (e.g., can’t access a course, grading glitches): Report to the instructor first, then IT Support if needed: [Request Brightspace Service](https://newpaltz.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1905/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=51541)

- **Email or account login issues**: Direct students (and yourself, if needed) to the campus IT Help Desk: [Submit a Ticket](https://newpaltz.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1905/Portal/Requests/ServiceCatalog)

- **Classroom technology problems** (projector, software, etc.): A common issue is the projector not working when instructing a lab. Instead of submitting a ticket, which could take hours, **call them directly** at **[845-257-4357]((tel:8452574357))**. Explain the situation, and they will have someone come down as soon as possible to fix the issue. 

---
## What TRs/TAs Should NOT Do

- Do not attempt to repair or reset institutional accounts.  
- Do not install unauthorized software on lab or classroom computers.  
- Do not share admin or instructor login credentials.  

---
## Where to Go for Help

- **Course Instructor** – first point of contact for anything course-related (see [[Important Contacts]]).  
- **[IT Help Desk](https://newpaltz.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1905/Portal/Home/)** – for technical support with accounts, email, or hardware.  
- [**Brightspace Support**](https://newpaltz.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1905/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=51541) – for grading, course content, or access problems.  

Keep these contacts saved for quick access. If you’re unsure where to go, always start with the instructor.

# How To Grade In Brightspace

1. Access course in Brightspace. (see [[How-To Access Course in Brightspace]])

- There are a few ways to grade depending on if the submissions are through [[#Online Submissions via Brightspace]] or if submissions are [[#Physical Submissions]].
- **NOTE:** Not all instructors will have you grade in Brightspace or at all. Be sure to clarify grading expectations with them.

## Online Submissions via Brightspace

2. If you are grading assignments that were submitted through Brightspace, one way to grade is by using the *Quick Eval* option. First, click on the ***Instructor Only*** button on the navigation bar. Then, click ***Quick Eval***.

# How To Use The Projector In Lab


## Using the School Computer

1. If using the attached school computer, first, log into the computer at the front of the room using your SUNY New Paltz username (**do not** include @newpaltz.edu) and password. If you are using your own computer, jump to [[#Using Your Own Computer]].

2. Depending on the classroom, there will either be a small tablet-like screen, or a black device with similar buttons shown below next to the computer. If there is a screen, tap the screen to wake it up. Click on **Display On***.

![projector tablet screen](projector_screen.png)

3. Click on ***PC*** to project what is on the school computer.
## Using Your Own Computer

1. If using your own computer, you can connect using  an HDMI cord, AirPlay or Crestron AirMedia. Not all projector systems have AirPlay or Crestron AirMedia. Double check what the lab/classroom you are assigned to has available. Having an HDMI cord is a good idea to have with you if you are planning to use your own computer due to the unpredictability with each projector system.

2. To display an image from an HDMI source:
	- Connect your equipment using an HDMI cable that you provide to the HDMI port on the front of the instructor station or desktop.
	- Press the **HDMI** button on the control panel

3. To wirelessly display a personal device through Crestron AirMedia:
	- Press the **AIR MEDIA** button on the control panel
	- Please read **[How To Use Crestron AirMedia](https://newpaltz.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/KB/ArticleDet?ID=32528)**


## Other features

- Press the **FREEZE** button to freeze the image on the Projector
- Press the **BLANK** button to temporary blank the image on the Projector
- Press the up directional button to raise the projector screen
- Press the down directional button to lower the projector screen
- Press the center directional button to stop the projector screen
- Use the volume knob to control audio levels in the room

# Office Hours


Office hours are your opportunity to provide students with extra help, answer questions, and support their learning outside of class. They are an important part of your responsibilities as a TA.

---
## Setting Up Office Hours

- Decide on the day and time of your hours before the first week of classes. 
	- Part-time TRs/TAs must hold **1.5 hours per week**
	- Full-time TRs/TAs must hold **3 hours per week**
	- Make sure your hours are not during lecture hours!

- Once decided, notify administrative assistant, Ashlee Dykeman ([dykemana2@newpaltz.edu](mailto:dykemana2@newpaltz.edu)), and your instructor your intended hours. Ashlee will assign you either room SH 240 or 241.
	- You will be given card access to both rooms at the beginning of the semester. If you don't have access, please let Ashlee know. 

- Hold office hours at the **time and location arranged with your instructor**. If you must move locations, make an announcement via Brightspace.    
- Share your office hours via a Brightspace announcement and/or with your students on the first day of lab. Some instructors will include your hours on their syllabus. 

---
## Expectations

- Arrive on time and stay for the full duration.  
- Be approachable, respectful, and patient.  
- Come prepared with course materials so you can reference them if needed.  

---
## Working with Students

- Encourage students to ask questions and guide them toward solutions instead of simply giving answers.  
- Offer tips, hints, and strategies that help students learn.  
- Keep explanations clear and adjust based on the student’s level of understanding.  
- Respect confidentiality. Do not discuss other students’ grades or performance.  

---
## Handling Challenges

- If a student becomes frustrated or confrontational, remain calm and professional.  
	  - Listen, acknowledge their concern, and suggest following up with the instructor if needed.  
- If you cannot answer a question, be honest. Take note and follow up after checking with the instructor.  
- If very few students attend, use the time to review materials, grade assignments, or do your own coursework. 

---
## Cancellations & Rescheduling

- If you must miss office hours due to illness or another conflict:  
	  - Inform the instructor as soon as possible.  
	  - Post an announcement (through Brightspace or email) to let students know.  
	  - If appropriate, reschedule a make-up session.  

---
Office hours are about building trust and providing students with the extra support they need. Your approachability and consistency make a big difference!


---

---

# Technical Help


As a TA, you may encounter technical issues, whether in Brightspace, email, or other course-related systems. While you are **not responsible for fixing technical problems**, it’s important to know where to direct questions and how to handle issues if they arise.

---
## Common Scenarios

- **Brightspace issues** (e.g., can’t access a course, grading glitches): Report to the instructor first, then IT Support if needed: [Request Brightspace Service](https://newpaltz.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1905/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=51541)

- **Email or account login issues**: Direct students (and yourself, if needed) to the campus IT Help Desk: [Submit a Ticket](https://newpaltz.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1905/Portal/Requests/ServiceCatalog)

- **Classroom technology problems** (projector, software, etc.): A common issue is the projector not working when instructing a lab. Instead of submitting a ticket, which could take hours, **call them directly** at **[845-257-4357]((tel:8452574357))**. Explain the situation, and they will have someone come down as soon as possible to fix the issue. 

---
## What TRs/TAs Should NOT Do

- Do not attempt to repair or reset institutional accounts.  
- Do not install unauthorized software on lab or classroom computers.  
- Do not share admin or instructor login credentials.  

---
## Where to Go for Help

- **Course Instructor** – first point of contact for anything course-related (see [[Important Contacts]]).  
- **[IT Help Desk](https://newpaltz.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1905/Portal/Home/)** – for technical support with accounts, email, or hardware.  
- [**Brightspace Support**](https://newpaltz.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1905/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=51541) – for grading, course content, or access problems.  

Keep these contacts saved for quick access. If you’re unsure where to go, always start with the instructor.

# How To Use The Projector In Lab


## Using the School Computer

1. If using the attached school computer, first, log into the computer at the front of the room using your SUNY New Paltz username (**do not** include @newpaltz.edu) and password. If you are using your own computer, jump to [[#Using Your Own Computer]].

2. Depending on the classroom, there will either be a small tablet-like screen, or a black device with similar buttons shown below next to the computer. If there is a screen, tap the screen to wake it up. Click on **Display On***.

![projector tablet screen](projector_screen.png)

3. Click on ***PC*** to project what is on the school computer.
## Using Your Own Computer

1. If using your own computer, you can connect using  an HDMI cord, AirPlay or Crestron AirMedia. Not all projector systems have AirPlay or Crestron AirMedia. Double check what the lab/classroom you are assigned to has available. Having an HDMI cord is a good idea to have with you if you are planning to use your own computer due to the unpredictability with each projector system.

2. To display an image from an HDMI source:
	- Connect your equipment using an HDMI cable that you provide to the HDMI port on the front of the instructor station or desktop.
	- Press the **HDMI** button on the control panel

3. To wirelessly display a personal device through Crestron AirMedia:
	- Press the **AIR MEDIA** button on the control panel
	- Please read **[How To Use Crestron AirMedia](https://newpaltz.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/KB/ArticleDet?ID=32528)**


## Other features

- Press the **FREEZE** button to freeze the image on the Projector
- Press the **BLANK** button to temporary blank the image on the Projector
- Press the up directional button to raise the projector screen
- Press the down directional button to lower the projector screen
- Press the center directional button to stop the projector screen
- Use the volume knob to control audio levels in the room
