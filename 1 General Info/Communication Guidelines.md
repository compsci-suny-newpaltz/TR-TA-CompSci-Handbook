# Communication Guidelines

Strong and respectful communication is key to your success as a Teacher of Record. You’ll interact with students, faculty, and possibly other TRs, so here are a few best practices to help keep everything running smoothly.

---
## Email & Messaging

- Use your official school email when communicating with students and faculty.
- Check your email regularly (at least once a day on weekdays).
- Aim to respond to emails from students and instructors within **24–48 hours**.
- Use clear subject lines and professional greetings.

> Example:  
> *Subject: Question about Homework 3 Grading*  
> *Hi <Student's Name>,*  
> *Thanks for your message. I reviewed your assignment and here's what I found...*

## Interacting with Students

- Be kind, respectful, and patient.
- Avoid sarcasm or overly informal language. Remember, you’re in a position of authority.
- If you’re unsure how to handle a situation, or a student becomes confrontational, reach out to the instructor.
- Never discuss other students’ performance or personal situations unless with the instructor.

---
## Communicating with Faculty

- Let the instructor know if you're going to be unavailable or need help.
- Share any student issues that might require follow-up (e.g., missing assignments, struggling students, academic honesty concerns).
- When in doubt, ask!

---
## Professionalism Reminder

- Never gossip or speak negatively about students or faculty.
- Keep communication polite, even when setting boundaries or correcting misunderstandings.

Consistent, respectful communication helps create a positive learning environment for everyone.
